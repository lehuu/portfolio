ARD is a broadcasting association consisting of the state broadasters and the Deutsche Welle and is part of the public service media in Germany. Their internal programplanning software was newly developed for the modern software landscape to ensure long-term stability and performance. We supported ARD with developers for the native Windows application and for the migration of legacy data into the new system.
