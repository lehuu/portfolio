Homo Digitalis was a scientific experiment run in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute. 
It posed the question "How much longer will we remain human?". It was comprised of a video webseries and an online questionnaire. We developed the online survey which was both accessible via a webpage and a Facebook bot. The survey consisted of interactive questions and games to test the participants' affinity for the digital world.
