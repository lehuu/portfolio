Kerngedanke aims to be the firehose for all social media by funneling content posted from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and Youtube through its platform. Users no longer have to hunt down what's happening on their online presences on separate apps and websites.

Kerngedanke provides a clear overview of activities across platforms and allows for fast content storage, analysis, reusability, planning and distribution.
