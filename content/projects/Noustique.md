The Scent Creator is a fully connected small home appliance that users can operate with a mobile app. The native iOS app allows users to connect to their appliance and manage the status of their scent cartridges. 

Its main function is the mixing of new perfumes by selecting options based on the loaded cartridges or creating new ones from scratch. Those new creations can then also be shared with the community.
