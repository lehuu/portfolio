Space Night is the name of a German television program in the early night/morning hours each day. It is a mixture of chill-out-music and images of the earth as seen from space interspersed with informative broadcasts.

To bring Space Night into a more interactive digital age, we built a VR version for the Oculus Rift. The player is put into the void of space surrounded by stars. He/she floats by asteroids, black holes and other astronomical phenoma, all synced to the music.
