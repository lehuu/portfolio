StudySmarter is a leading EdTech Start-Up from Munich. Coming out of TU Munich & LMU Munich, StudySmarter develops an intelligent, content agnostic platform for lifelong learning. The StudySmarter web platform went online in 2018 and is used by over 1 million learners in the DACH region. To make the app more accessible, a cross-platform mobile application was developed. We supported StudySmarter actively onsite in the development, testing and release process of the app.
